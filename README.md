# ðŸ¤– RAG CV Analyzer â€“ Match Your CV with Job Requirements using LLMs

RAG CV Analyzer is a chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) designed to evaluate how well your Curriculum Vitae (CV) aligns with specific Job Requirements. It leverages FastAPI as the backend to handle file uploads and user interactions, while using a local LLM through Ollama to generate private, context-aware responsesâ€”ensuring data privacy and fully local processing without reliance on external cloud services.
